Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard :-
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze hospital patient data across multiple dimensions such as age group, specialty, case type, and time. The dashboard provides clear insights that help hospitals identify trends, improve operations, and make data-driven decisions.

Purpose of This Project :-
•	To analyze hospital performance across categories
•	To identify peak and low patient flow periods
•	To compare specialty-wise patient loads
•	To support decision-making for resource allocation
•	To improve hospital efficiency through data-driven insights

Tech Stack :-
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
•  Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
•  Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
•  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

Key Features :-
1. KPI Highlights
•	Total Patients: 18M+
•	Average Patients: 44
•	Current Year Patients: 5.86M
•	Past Year Patients: 7.27M
These KPI cards give a quick snapshot of overall hospital performance.

2. Interactive Slicers
Users can filter the dashboard based on:
•	Adult/Child
•	Patient Name
•	Specialty Group
•	Time Bands
This allows custom, focused analysis depending on the user's need.
